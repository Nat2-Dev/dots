# Kieran's Dots

> [!CAUTION]
> These dots are highly prone to change / breakage. I am not a nix os expert (this is my first time touching nix), so I'm not sure if this will work or not. I'm just trying to get my dots up on github. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

## Installation

I have absolutely no idea

## Screenshots

ðŸ«¡ Will report back!
